# Project Overview

This project analyzes U.S. hospital quality metrics using SQL, focusing on mortality, readmission rates, patient experience, and effective care measures. The analysis combines multiple CMS datasets using BigQuery, performs data cleaning and joining operations, and produces insights on hospital performance at both national and state levels.

## Objectives
- Create a unified hospital quality score
- Rank hospitals nationally and by state
- Identify top and bottom performers
- Explore quality distribution across performance tiers
- Produce professional visualizations for a portfolio-ready case study

## Key Deliverables
- Cleaned datasets (CSV)
- SQL queries and CTE-based transformations
- Statistical summaries and performance rankings
- Four high-quality charts exported from Google Sheets
- Final PDF report (to be uploaded when complete)

This project demonstrates SQL expertise, data cleaning, joins, CTEs, aggregation, visualization, and documentation.
